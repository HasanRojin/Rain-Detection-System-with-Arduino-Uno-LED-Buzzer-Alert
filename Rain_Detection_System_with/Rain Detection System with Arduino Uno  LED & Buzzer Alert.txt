Title: Rain Detection System with Arduino Uno | LED & Buzzer Alert

Description:

Welcome to Barcode! In this tutorial, we'll show you how to create a practical **rain detection system** using an **Arduino Uno**, an **LED**, a **buzzer**, and a **water sensor**. üåßÔ∏èüîß
 Components Needed:
- Arduino Uno
- Water sensor (rain sensor)
- LED
- Buzzer
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)

 Wiring Diagram:
1. Water Sensor:
   - Connect the VCC pin of the water sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect the GND pin of the water sensor to the GND pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect the signal pin (S) of the water sensor to an analog input pin (e.g., A0) on the Arduino.

2. LED:
   - Connect the positive leg (longer leg) of the LED to a digital pin (e.g., D8) on the Arduino through a current-limiting resistor (220Œ©).
   - Connect the negative leg (shorter leg) of the LED to the GND pin on the Arduino.

3. Buzzer:
   - Connect the positive terminal of the buzzer to a digital pin (e.g., D9) on the Arduino.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the buzzer to the GND pin on the Arduino.


 Explanation:
- The water sensor reads the moisture level and outputs an analog value.
- If the sensor value exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 500), the LED lights up and the buzzer sounds.
- You can adjust the threshold value based on your specific sensor and requirements.
